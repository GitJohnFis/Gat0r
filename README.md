## Welcome to the Blog Aggre- _gator_

We're building an RSS feed aggregator in TypeScript called **Gator** üêä. This CLI tool allows users to:

- **Add RSS feeds** from across the internet.
- **Store collected posts** in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Follow and unfollow RSS feeds** added by other users.
- **View summaries** of aggregated posts in the terminal, with links to the full posts.
